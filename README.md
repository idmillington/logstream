Logstream
=========

Logstream is a project for building a secure, verifiable message
stream server, capable of running in real time.

Technology is based on Node.js talking to MongoDB.

Please see http://idmillington.github.com/logstream for a walkthrough
of the project.

Currently there is no implementation here. The project has been
created to gain feedback on where I am going with this. I'll add the
source code in due course.
