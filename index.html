      <h2>Logstreams</h2>
      <p>
        A logstream is a publically verifiable set of messages related
        to a single topic. You can think of it as a Facebook feed for
        projects, tasks, or anything you want to track; a twitter feed
        for data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you're having a new house built. That's a complex
        process, with lots of tasks in progress at once. Let's focus
        on one: the interior design for your new kitchen. You create a
        logstream to track that.
      </p>

      </ul>


      <h2 id="data">Changing Data</h2>
      <p>
        Logstreams have a set of data associated with them. The data
        is made up of key-value pairs (in fact they can be much more
        complex, and include arbitrary data structures, but key-value
        pairs allow us to do some neat analysis). Lets say we begin with:
      </p>
<pre>{
  title: Kitchen Interior,
  tags: [interior, furnishings, phase-3, kitchen],
  budget: 14000,
  deadline: 2011-12-18,
  responsible: Anne
}</pre>
      <p><small> NB: In the examples, curly braces just show data that
          belongs together, while square brackets show a list of
          similar bits of data. This is only for convenience, though
          it is similar to the way messages are represented in code
          (they are in JSON format). When using logstream, however,
          you work through a user interface with fields to fill in,
          drop down lists, etc, so you don't have to work with the
          underlying data.
      </small></p>
      <p>
        A logstream isn't a to do list. You don't have to break topics
        down into steps. You can, but it isn't required. In this
        example we won't.
      </p>
      <p>
        You modify a topic by adding <strong>messages</strong> to
        it. There are lots of different kind of messages. One kind of
        message is a change to one of its bits of data. For example,
        we have to squeeze the budget a bit, so the following message
        is sent.
      </p>
<pre>{
  type: modify,
  key: budget,
  value: 13000
}</pre>

      <h2 id="messages">Messages</h2>
      <p>
        Modifying data is only one kind of message: the <tt>modify</tt>
        message. But that is just the tiniest tip of the iceberg for
        logstreams. Messages can be of any type, and the stream of
        messages acts just like a facebook stream or a twitter
        feed. Coming back to our example: Anne, the interior designer,
        finds a superb light-fitting, and wants to get feedback on
        it. She adds the message:
      </p>
<pre>{
  type: file-uploads,
  image: [uploaded file],
  comment: What do you think about this, Bill, for beside the pantry?
}</pre>
      <p>
        This message, and the attached image is added to the stream
        alongside all the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no restrictions to the message types, or the date
        they contain. There are a few defaults, however. For defaults
        we've seen <tt>file-upload</tt>s, and <tt>modify</tt>
        messages. There are also messages to change stream permissions
        (more on permissions below). You can email a special email
        address for a stream, and anything email to that (or cc'ed to
        it) will be added to the stream as an <tt>email</tt> message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often you don't want a message to appear in the stream at the
        point where you send it. You might want to set up a reminder
        for a later date, for example. A <tt>deferred</tt> message
        type allows you to add another message to be played at a later
        date. And such a scheduled message can be altered or
        descheduled by further messages.
      </p>
<pre>{
  type: deferred,
  when: 2011-11-23T12:00:00.0,
  deferred-message: {
    type: warning,
    comment: Only one month to go, folks.
  }
}</pre>
      <p>
        Another common use case is when you want several messages to
        all hit at exactly the same time: either all of them or none
        of them. For example, you may need to change a budget and a
        delivery date at the same time, without any risk that anyone
        could see one change without the other. To do this you can use
        a <tt>group</tt> message, that combines multiple other
        messages together.
      </p>
<pre>{
  type: group,
  sub-messages: [{
    type: modify,
    key: budget,
    value: 12000
  },{
    type: modify,
    key: deadline,
    value: 2011-12-23
  }]
}</pre>
      <p>
        Initially I said that streams can have data associated with
        them, which can then be modified using <tt>modify</tt>
        messages. Well all stream activity has to occur through
        messages. The initial block of data associated with a stream
        is added with a <tt>group</tt> message of this kind. Without a
        message, a stream is featureless and void.
      </p>
      <img src="ios.png" style="float:right; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 0.5em; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
      <p>
        These defaults cover 99% of use-cases, but messages not
        covered by this can be added to the stream without
        modification. Some messages might need special behavior,
        however, and in most cases messages will need to be edited and
        viewed in a user interface (UI). UI handlers for editing a
        viewing a new message type can be registered, and a core
        handler can be registered to handle special message types.
      </p>

      <h2 id="perms">People and Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        Streams are aggregated into projects. A project might be your
        house being built. Whereas the streams may be individual tasks
        that need accomplishing, or areas of the build.
      </p>
      <p>
        Streams can be shared with multiple people. For each stream,
        you can have a global list of people who can see that stream,
        and who can add messages to the stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, for each message type, you can override the
        general settings and set read and create permissions for
        specific users. So for example, you might want Anne's
        assistant, Carl, to be able to see the interior design stream,
        but not anything related to the budget. You can simply set
        Carl to not have read permissions on budget-related messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a project, each user can drill down into the streams they
        have permission for and see the messages they have permission
        to see. They can also see a combined stream, showing all the
        messages on all the streams in that project (subject to their
        permissions). This forms a Facebook-feed like view of
        everything important to a project.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tracking">Data Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        At the start of this explanation, I mentioned that key-value
        data associated with the stream can be analysed. For many
        kinds of data (anything for a time, date or quantities, for
        example), you can view the message stream as a graph. You can
        ask to see the graph of the budget over time, for example.
      </p>
      <div id="chart_div"></div>
      <p>
        If you were using a logstream to chart the progress of a
        project, you could use this to graph the defect rate over
        time. For a logstream to track your weight loss, it could
        graph your weight over time.
      </p>

      <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
      <p>
        Using messages exclusively means the whole history of changes
        and updates is captured in the set of messages. In fact,
        messages internally are stored with more data than just
        that shown above. The first message might be stored as:
      </p>
<pre>{
  by: {
    username: bill,
    auth: [...]
  },
  when: 2011-08-01T12:57:46.0,
  message: {
    type: modify,
    key: budget,
    value: 13000
  },
  parent: "93731c2b73e0beb312a1b11f443b22018f63cf9b0dbfd35e10e146c3db36ef15"
}</pre>
      <p>
        The message is stored along with who created the message,
        an <tt>auth</tt> block of data that is used to validate that
        the person who created the message really was who they claimed
        to be (the details of that are not important here), the time
        when the message was added and the message content iself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt>when</tt> and <tt>by</tt> of a message allows us to
        track when things happened. If you're expecting the kitchen
        designer to send you plans for agreement by Tuesday, and they
        don't turn up until Friday, then the time logging shows that
        clearly. And as we'll see below, it shows it in a way that is
        impossible to fake.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is that huge dump of random characters
        labelled <tt>parent</tt> at the end?  Well this is where
        things get neat. Messages are held in a stream - a sequence,
        where each message keeps track of the one message that came
        before it. When a new message is added, its parent is the last
        one on the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a message is added, its parent is found, and then the
        whole message object is passed through an algorithm called
        a <strong>secure hash algorithm</strong> to produce a long
        number, which is the message's identity. The interesting thing
        about this number is that, if you have the number, you can't
        fake a message that matches it. If I have the number for a
        message, I can guarantee that the contents of that message
        haven't been tampered with. And because that message contains
        the secure hash for its parent, I can guarantee that the whole
        stream of messages hasn't been tampered with, right back to
        the first message.
      </p>
      <p>
        How secure is this? Well the message identities are created by
        a system called SHA256, that is certified by the US National
        Security Agency as being secure for government, intelligence
        and military communications to the highest level.
      </p>

      <h2 id="proof">Provability</h2>
      <p>
        Put another way, if whatever you're tracking ends up in court,
        anyone with a message number can verify the entire prior
        history of everything in that stream. There is no way to
        change anything without that number changing. But on the other
        hand, if you have the number, there is no way of being able to
        figure out what the original message was either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which makes this approach great for situations with restricted
        permissions. For example, I am a contractor on your house
        build. I don't get to see everything, but I can add status
        update messages to some streams. Every time I do that, I get a
        <strong>receipt</strong>: the message identity of the message
        I just added. That means I can verify everything that was in
        the stream at the point of me sending the message, even if I
        don't have access to the stream data, or the computers they
        sit on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is this important?  Well imagine that I fall out with
        Anne, the interior designer. I think she recklessly overspent
        her budget. She claims I reduced the budget after I knew she'd
        ordered an expensive kitchen suite. She has a receipt for the
        message where she tells me she ordered the kitchen. That
        receipt alone <em>proves</em> one way or another whether my
        change in budget was before or after that point. Even if I
        were to go fiddling around in the database, and can make
        changes to the stored data, her receipt proves that I've been
        tampering. I can't even claim that the database was corrupted,
        because that too would show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        And because permissions are also changed by message, the same
        process allows us to prove who had access to what information
        when. If someone claims that they weren't given access to a
        piece of data until it was too late: any receipt after that
        point verifies whether this is true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because receipts verify the content, but don't give it away,
        they are made public. Anyone can see the receipt of a stream
        at any time. This allows everyone with an interest in a stream
        to keep occasional copies of the receipt, and in doing so it
        ensures that the data is kept without modification.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <h3>A Note About Security and Provability</h3>
        <p>
          The security features of logstream are powerful, but
          entirely behind the scenes. Logstream is designed to be used
          in applications where they are needed, but it isn't limited
          to those applications. If you're just tracking your
          swim-times, or you want a stream for private use to track a
          consulting job, that's fine too. The security features won't
          get in the way.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="apps">Applications</h2>

      <p>
        Logstream is intended for use whenever you need to track
        something. Whether it is a quantity that changes over time, or
        periodic events that happen. Whether it is a conversation, or
        a project. The applications are unlimited. Here are some
        examples.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Track project progress, allowing different parties to see
          different streams within a project. Keep up to date with the
          whole project from one overview, and drill into each stream
          to analyse its data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a stream to track the changing version of a
          document. Each time someone changes the document and sends
          it to the stream, the version is logged. There is never any
          confusion which is the latest, or who has changed it when.
        </li>
        <li>
          Track your running times as you train for a 10K race. Give
          your friends and family access to your stream, and they can
          post comments and encouragement, and add photos of the big
          day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a stream for every client you do work for. Given them
          access to te stream. You can track the hours worked, add
          reminders to the stream and use it as a base for
          documents. And you can keep stuff that the client shouldn't
          see invisible, while allowing them to see and comment on the
          stuff you do want to share.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a stream to monitor server-events. Direct error messages
          to the appropriate stream, and see the messages appear in
          real time.
        </li>
      </ul>
